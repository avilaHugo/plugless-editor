# Plugless Editor

This repository is dedicated to providing lightweight editor configurations that don't rely on plugins. The primary goal is to offer configurations for built-in editors such as Nano, Vim, and Emacs, allowing users to create a functional work environment by simply connecting via SSH or copying files to a remote server. Please keep in mind that these configurations are personal and designed according to my preferences. While they are shared here for the community's benefit, it's advisable to use them with care and consider adapting them to your specific needs.
